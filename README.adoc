= SLF4J Binding to JBoss Logging

The https://www.slf4j.org/[SLF4J] binding to JBoss Logging is just as it sounds. It's a
https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#swapping[SLF4J binding] which sends log messages through JBoss Logging. While this
may seem odd to redirect log messages from one logging facade to another, it's useful in some cases. This project is
currently used in https://wildfly.org[WildFly] and
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform[JBoss EAP].

== Usage

To use the project you need both SLF4J and JBoss Logging on your class path. Then simply add this library and it should
be picked up as the SLF4J binding.
